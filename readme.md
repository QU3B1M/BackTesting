# Backtesting with BackTrader

In this project im using *BackTrader* to test diferent strategies against historical market data.

Acording to its creator, BackTrader is...
> A feature-rich Python framework for backtesting and trading.

You can use this repo as boilerplate example for your Backtesting scripts

For now we only have 3 available strategies *`(test_strategy, golden_cross and buy_hold)`*\
but i'll keep updating this repo with a lot more.

## Usage

Well start running these back tests is pretty easy, you can do it in only 2 steps:

- Install all the dependencies by the command `pip install -r requirements.t xt`

- Run the scripts with the command `python main.py golden_cross` 
>(*in this case im using golden cross, but u can use any.*)

## Good to mention

My name is Kevin Ledesma im a Python developer and my ambition is to learn and to share my\
knowledge as I keep learning.

Any kind of comment, recommendation, correction is welcome!
